\begin{abstract}
The existence of a non-zero neutron electric dipole moment (nEDM) would violate parity and time-reversal symmetry.  Extensions to the Standard Model predict the nEDM to be $10^{-26}$ -- $10^{-28}$~e$\cdot$cm.  The current best upper limit set by Sussex/RAL/ILL nEDM experiment is $3.0 \times 10^{-26}$~e$\cdot$cm\cite{bestLim_1,bestLim_2}.  The nEDM experiment at TRIUMF is aiming at the $10^{-27}$~e$\cdot$cm sensitivity level.  We are developing the world's highest density source of UCN.  The experiment requires a very stable ($<$~pT) and homogeneous ($<$~nT/m) magnetic field ($B_0$) within the measurement cell.  

My involvement in the nEDM experiment is the development of active magnetic shielding to stabilize the external magnetic field by compensation coils. I have optimized a prototype active magnetic shield at The University of Winnipeg. I have also simulated the behaviour of the coils in the presence of the passive magnetic shields  using finite element analysis (FEA), and made comparisons with  experimental results  to test the successfulness of the control system. A major challenge of the active 
compensation system is its  slow current response.  This is now understood and several recommendations are made to improve the performance in future realizations of such a system.

%  This thesis discussed my journey to understand the system and recommendations for future researchers in active compensation field.



% .Moreover, the magnetic environment at TRIUMF is more challenging than in our lab in Winnipeg, because of the closeness of the experiment to the TRIUMF cyclotron (B $\sim 350 - 400$ $\mu$T 'which is almost one order of magnitude larger than usual background fields') and the changing environment with iron.  Studies of the implementation at TRIUMF will also be reported.

% By the grace of almighty Allah, I am finishing my Masters in Physics. It was a very tough decision to switch from engineering into the world of particle physics. I am grateful to my supervisor Dr.~Jeff Martin for believing in me, and always be kind throughout my Masters journey. He has given me unparalleled freedom to feel a foreign land as my second home. He has always guided me whenever I got stuck in my project and helped me solving the problems. He has given me the opportunity to attend several conferences all over Canada beyond the imagination of a Masters student. His contributions to my research as well as while writing this thesis are phenomenal. His mentoring and passion for exploring the mysteries of this project motivated me in every step. He has been influential in my growth as a student as well as a better researcher. 

% Next important person who made my Masters life smoother is David Ostapchuk. He is a very talented person with enormous patience. I had absolutely no idea how and from where to begin my research. Dave helped me tremendously to settle in, to understand and write codes as well as to build apparatus for my research project. In addition to my supervisor, whenever I faced problems, I knew that I could always rely on Dave for solution.

% I would also like to thank my co-supervisor Dr.~Chris Bidinosti, for his generous help and support during my Masters journey. I am grateful to Dr.~Russell Mammei for his contribution in OPERA simulation. I am also grateful to Dr.~Beatrice Franke and Dr.~Blair Jamieson for their valuable suggestions during my research work. 

% The graduate students specially Dr.~Taraneh Andalib, Sakib Rahman, Michael Lang, Moushumi Das, Ray Dwaipayan, Sean Hansen-Romu and Wolfgang Klassen have helped me a lot. I am thankful to each of them. It has been an honor to be part of this wonderful team and project.

% Last but not the least, I would thank my family and friends who have supported me always.
